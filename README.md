# Multilayer-Perceptron-Neural-Network

#### Classified Handwritten Digits from MNIST Dataset
#### Implemented a Multilayer Perceptron Neural Network

The process involved the following tasks,
* Implement a three layer (one hidden layer) Neural Network (forward and back propagation) 
* Incorporation of regularization constant on the weights, 
* Tune hyper-parameters for Neural Network (number of units in the hidden layer and $\lambda$)

#### The same network was used to analyze a more complex face dataset so as to gauge the performance of the constructed neural network against a deep neural network using the TensorFlow library.
